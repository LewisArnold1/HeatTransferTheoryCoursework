# Heat Transfer Design Problem - Python Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts that solve a series of heat transfer design problems, covering steady-state and transient heat transfer calculations. The scripts include iterative methods for solving surface, cover, and outlet temperatures in a solar collector system.

## Repository Structure

### **Scripts**
- `Design_1_6.py` - Solves problems 1 to 6.
- `Design_7_9_print.py` - Iteratively solves for temperatures in problems 7-9 and prints results to the terminal.
- `Design_7_9_save.py` - Saves iteration results for problems 7-9 to an `.xlsx` file.
- `Design_7_9_sweep.py` - Conducts a parameter sweep of initial conditions and stores the corresponding converged values in an `.xlsx` file.

### **Results**
- The `results` folder contains outputs from the save and print scripts.
